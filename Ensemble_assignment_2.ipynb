Each tree learns slightly different patterns from the data, and averaging their predictions helps to smooth out individual errors and reduce variance.\n",
        "# Improving Generalization: The ensemble's prediction tends to generalize better to unseen data because it aggregates the predictions of multiple models that have been trained on slightly different subsets of the data.\n",
